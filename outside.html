            <p> It's a cold stormy night in a rural area; you and your 3 friends are out driving out late. The radio talks about a serial killer still at large. The car suddenly begins to power down. Out of gas. </p>
            <p> You notice an abandoned house and a barn house close to it. Maybe they have gas to spare. </p>
            <p> You and your friends decide to scavenge and see if there is gas. </p>
